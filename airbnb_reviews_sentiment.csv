OG Okin,1,"My host was allowed to keep $1045.63 . The listing was surrounded by bushes, and we never checked in due to terrible crime and safety in the neighborhood. Airbnb allows the host to use a non-refundable policy to defraud guests and compel us to stay or forfeit our money. This is totally unacceptable in the hospitality industry. GUEST IS NOT PRIORITY TO THIS COMPANY. Users is all that counts. Airbnb removed my review because they said it was not relevant to my stay- a stay i never had.",2025-05-19 22:06:03,-0.33125

Mahesh,1,They need to upgrade their payment method. Taking so much time to refund the amount. I have booked property on 10th may. due to account verification they have cancelled my booking. but my question is if your app needs verification to book the property then why did you charge before verification? and we are living in 2025 but this app features are from 80s. I contacted customer care so many times but even they don't know the solution. only solution is to wait until it is credited. not recommend,2025-05-16 22:05:18,0.14375

Nichole M.,4,the only thing I do not like about this app is that although they allow you to make an initial down payment and pay the rest off. they do not allow you to make payments you can only make one payment of the remainder.

If a guest damages or steals an item, air bnb devalues the item and pays only some of the amount it's worth. So you pay 20 or 30% per damaged item. Air bnb does not care about your property and they do not provide full property protection. For a 15% fee, I expect better coverage.

I like how you can filter for exactly what you need, and the messaging feature makes it simple to stay in touch with hosts. My only issue is that sometimes notifications are delayed, and the map view could be a bit more responsive. Still, it's a solid app that makes travel planning much easier. 4 out of 5!",2025-05-01 09:31:31,0.24226190476190476

Aaron Osborne,1,"I have booked several stays with no issues but this all changed on April 25, 2025. The bedding was very uncomfortable and lacked sufficient pillows. I did not sleep but maybe an hour and did not hear anything back from the host until after noticing how dirty the place was and leaving for good. Airbnb offered a partial refund. The host made a blatant false and retaliation review and Airbnb claimed it was within their policy. My personal policy requires me to never use this service again. ‚úåÔ∏è",2025-05-01 08:12:55,-0.17222222222222222
