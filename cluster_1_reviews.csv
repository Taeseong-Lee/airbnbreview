OG Okin,1,"My host was allowed to keep $1045.63 . The listing was surrounded by bushes, and we never checked in due to terrible crime and safety in the neighborhood. Airbnb allows the host to use a non-refundable policy to defraud guests and compel us to stay or forfeit our money. This is totally unacceptable in the hospitality industry. GUEST IS NOT PRIORITY TO THIS COMPANY. Users is all that counts. Airbnb removed my review because they said it was not relevant to my stay- a stay i never had.",2025-05-19 22:06:03,-0.33125,1
