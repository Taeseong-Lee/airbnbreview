D.D.W. Hudson,1,Terrible. I was left out to sea when a host made false accusations against me. There was evidence in the airbnb thread. There is significant deference given to the host against the guest. The host harassed and used abusive language because I preferred to communicate via the app versus my personal number. I reviewed the host and my review was taken down because I never stayed with host but host review was allowed to stay. I was the victim. They rewarded the bad guy and punished the good guy.,2025-03-24 03:46:27,2025Q1

Handling refunds and converting them to coupons has become their new game and you either take their offer even after their own blunders or they just go cold turkey on you and close all your pending complaints.

This is outrageous. If I cancelled a week before, I would get 0 of my 750$ I paid. In the meantime all the nicer places have been booked and the ones remaining have their prices up for the event. 35$ is a disproportionate amount considering the fact that the other way around it would cost me 750$.",2025-02-14 03:07:43,2025Q1

In my case their idea of customer support was AI generated generic nonsense which they sent me 20 hours after my request.

Recent reviews are the only way for a host to show the current state of their home or a ""progression"" of improvements made over time.

Nichole M.,4,the only thing I do not like about this app is that although they allow you to make an initial down payment and pay the rest off. they do not allow you to make payments you can only make one payment of the remainder. I just think it would be much more convenient to allow smaller payments up until the due date of the final amount. hopefully they will change this in the future. I will definitely use Airbnb again in the future hopefully by that time they will allow smaller payments of the reminder,2025-05-16 09:47:08,2025Q2

Peter Eckert,5,"AirBnB has provided affordable, quality accomodations with many diverse options to choose from. The verification is efficient and important to know who is requesting and offering lodging. My initial perception of AirBnB was overpriced condos for unrealistic slumlord tycoons, but I have found options that meet customers in-between 60 to 40 % of average budget prices. The diversity is from thousands of buyers and sellers on an open market that has successfully matched or beaten my fiscal limits.",2025-05-28 10:50:15,2025Q2

Yuan,1,"Experiences page after the update is terrible. After viewing an experience and returning to the search results, the page automatically resets to the top instead of where you left off so you have to scroll all the way down again.

David Sly,1,"I used to love this service, until I wrote an honest review. It wasn't scathing or hyper-critical, I just pointed out some things that were lacking, like bedside tables. The next booking I tried to make was cancelled, so I contacted the host & it was indicated that because of my previous review hosts would be unlikely to accept me. This is because AirBNB lists it's properties by ranking and anything less than 5 stars results in loss of income. What is the point of reviews if you can't be honest?",2025-05-02 19:41:29,2025Q2

Erin Spear,1,"By definition, a customer buys goods or services from a business. That implies a basic level of service and support when issues arise‚Äîespecially from Airbnb, which profits off every transaction. Unfortunately, Airbnb treats paying customers like we owe them something. When problems come up‚Äîlike safety concerns or being misled‚Äîdon‚Äôt expect meaningful help. You‚Äôll be bounced around or met with scripted replies that don't resolve your issue. You will not feel like someone who paid for a service.",2025-04-19 07:49:32,2025Q2

Air bnb does not care about your property and they do not provide full property protection. For a 15% fee, I expect better coverage.
